Final Project Requirements
Pick a project for which you think at least three different Analytics models might have been combined to create the solution.
Think carefully and critically about what models might be used to create the solution,how they would be combined, what specific data might be needed to use the models, how it might be collected, and how often it might need to be refreshed and the models re-run. 
DO NOT find a description online (or elsewhere) of what the company or organization actually did. Write a short report.
